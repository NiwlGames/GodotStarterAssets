# GodotStarterAssets
An expanding collection of high quality assets for the Godot engine made by [Niwl Games](https://niwl.games). At the moment it contains:

- First person controller.
- Third person controller.
- SDF based customizable reticle shader.

The controllers aim to be totally FPS independent and as responsible as possible. They support both Keyboard/mouse and gamepad.

Niwl Games is a cooperative. In order for us to continue the development of free and open source assets, consider supporting us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/Shipyard).
